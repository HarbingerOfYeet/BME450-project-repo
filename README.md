## Project Description
	The goal of this project is to predict a user's age and sex based on their vocal patterns. The user will speak into a 
	microphone and say a set phrase or a series of phrases. The model will use that input to output the user's age within 
	a range of 2 years and the user's sex. The dataset we plan to use is an online dataset of voice recordings. We will use
	a simple linear neural network to train the model. 
	
	We will use the AudioMNIST dataset from Becker et al. that has data for 60 different speakers speaking digits from 0-9. 
	The metadata included describes the speaker's age and sex.
