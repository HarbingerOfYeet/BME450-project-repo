## Project Description
	The goal of this project is to predict a user's age and sex based on their vocal patterns. The user will speak into a microphone and say a set phrase or a series of phrases. The model will use that input to output the user's age within a range of 2 years and the user's sex. The dataset we plan to use is an online dataset of voice recordings.
