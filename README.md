## Project Description
	The goal of this project is to predict a user's age based on their vocal patterns. The dataset we plan to use is Mozilla's
	Common Voice dataset. Common voice is an online database of thousands of voices that is commonly used for speech recognition
	purposes. Two stretch goals are to be able to record a user's voice and show their age category within seconds and predict the
	user's sex in addition to age. We plan to use an MLP to train on the dataset.
